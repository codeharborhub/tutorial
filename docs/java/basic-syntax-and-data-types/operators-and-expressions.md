## Operators

Java supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, etc.

### Arithmetic Operators

- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `%` (modulus)

Example:

```java
int sum = 10 + 5; // 15
int difference = 10 - 5; // 5
```

### Comparison Operators

- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

Example:

```java
boolean isEqual = (10 == 10); // true
boolean isGreater = (10 > 5); // true
```

### Logical Operators

- `&&` (logical AND)
- `||` (logical OR)
- `!` (logical NOT)

Example:

```java
boolean result = (true && false); // false
boolean orResult = (true || false); // true
```



## Conclusion

Understanding Java syntax and structure is crucial for writing effective and efficient Java programs. By mastering these basics, you can begin to build more complex and powerful applications.
