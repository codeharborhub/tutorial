Concurrency in Swift allows tasks to execute independently and potentially simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness in applications. It enables efficient utilization of multi-core processors and better handling of asynchronous operations.

```swift
import Foundation

// Define a function that simulates fetching data asynchronously
func fetchData() async throws -> String {
    return "Data fetched successfully"
}

// Example of using async/await
func asyncExample() async {
    do {
        let result = try await fetchData()
        print(result) // Output: Data fetched successfully
    } catch {
        print("Error fetching data: \(error)")
    }
}

// Run the async function
Task {
    await asyncExample()
}

// Example of using DispatchQueue for concurrent tasks
let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.concurrentQueue", attributes: .concurrent)

// Execute tasks asynchronously on the concurrent queue
concurrentQueue.async {
    for i in 1...5 {
        print("Task 1: \(i)")
    }
}

concurrentQueue.async {
    for j in 1...5 {
        print("Task 2: \(j)")
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Async/Await Example**:
   - `fetchData()` is an asynchronous function that returns a `String` and can throw errors (`throws`).
   - `asyncExample()` is an asynchronous function that calls `fetchData()` using `await`, handling potential errors.
   - The `Task` block asynchronously executes `asyncExample()`.

2. **DispatchQueue Example**:
   - `concurrentQueue` is created with `.concurrent` attribute, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently.
   - Two tasks are dispatched asynchronously on `concurrentQueue`, printing sequential numbers for each task.

### Concepts:

- **Async/Await**: Simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing functions to pause execution (`await`) until a result is available.
- **DispatchQueue**: Manages the execution of tasks asynchronously, either concurrently or serially.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Ensures tasks can execute independently and concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
