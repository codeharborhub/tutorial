# Working with Files and Directories in Java

## Introduction

Working with files and directories is a common task in Java programming. Java provides the `java.io` and `java.nio.file` packages to handle file and directory operations. This guide covers basic file and directory operations, such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories.

## 1. Creating Files and Directories

### Creating a File

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCreationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("example.txt");
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created successfully");
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating a Directory

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryCreationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File directory = new File("example");
        if (directory.mkdir()) {
            System.out.println("Directory created successfully");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to create directory");
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Java provides comprehensive APIs for working with files and directories, allowing you to perform various operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories. By understanding and using these APIs effectively, you can manipulate files and directories in your Java applications with ease.
