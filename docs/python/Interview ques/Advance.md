1. **Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python. What are its implications on concurrency and multi-threading?**
   - **Answer:** The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, ensuring only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This limits multi-threaded performance for CPU-bound tasks but allows efficient I/O-bound tasks and simplifies memory management.

2. **Discuss Python's memory management mechanism, including reference counting and garbage collection. How does it impact performance and memory usage?**
   - **Answer:** Python uses reference counting to manage object lifetimes and garbage collection (cyclic GC) to detect and clean up unused objects. While efficient for most cases, cyclic GC can introduce overhead and occasional delays due to periodic collection runs.

3. **Explain the use of Python's `asyncio` module for asynchronous programming. How does it differ from threads and multiprocessing?**
   - **Answer:** `asyncio` enables concurrent I/O-bound operations using coroutines (`async` and `await`), managed by an event loop. Unlike threads and multiprocessing, `asyncio` is single-threaded but supports thousands of tasks due to cooperative multitasking, suitable for scalable network applications.

4. **What are Python decorators, and how can they be used for metaprogramming? Provide examples of their application in modifying function behavior.**
   - **Answer:** Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are powerful for metaprogramming tasks like logging, authentication, and caching.
     ```python
     def my_decorator(func):
         def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
             print('Before function execution')
             result = func(*args, **kwargs)
             print('After function execution')
             return result
         return wrapper

     @my_decorator
     def say_hello():
         print('Hello!')

     say_hello()  # Output: Before function execution, Hello!, After function execution
     ```

5. **Discuss the use of metaclasses in Python. Provide an example of how they can be used to customize class creation behavior.**
   - **Answer:** Metaclasses allow customization of class creation by overriding the default `__new__` and `__init__` methods of `type`. They are useful for enforcing class constraints, adding class-level methods, or modifying attribute handling during class instantiation.
     ```python
     class MyMeta(type):
         def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
             dct['attr'] = 100
             return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

     class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
         pass

     print(MyClass.attr)  # Output: 100
     ```

6. **Explain the concept of Python descriptors. Provide examples of how they can be used to control attribute access and modification.**
   - **Answer:** Descriptors are objects that define how attribute access is handled by defining `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` methods. They are used for implementing managed attributes with custom behavior.
     ```python
     class Temperature:
         def __init__(self, celsius=0):
             self._celsius = celsius

         def to_fahrenheit(self):
             return (self._celsius * 9/5) + 32

         def get_temperature(self):
             print("Getting value")
             return self._celsius

         def set_temperature(self, value):
             if value < -273.15:
                 raise ValueError("Temperature below -273.15 is not possible")
             print("Setting value")
             self._celsius = value

         temperature = property(get_temperature, set_temperature)

     # Usage
     t = Temperature()
     t.temperature = 30  # Setting value
     print(t.temperature)  # Getting value, Output: 30
     ```

7. **Discuss the usage and benefits of Python's `collections` module. Provide examples of commonly used data structures from this module.**

They enable dynamic attribute retrieval (`__getattr__`), assignment (`__setattr__`), and deletion (`__delattr__`), facilitating object-oriented programming paradigms and metaprogramming techniques for implementing custom behavior and data encapsulation.
      ```python
      class DynamicAttributes:
          def __init__(self):
              self._attrs = {}

          def __getattr__(self, name):
              if name in self._attrs:
                  return self._attrs[name]
              else:
                  raise AttributeError(f'{self.__class__.__name__} object has no attribute {name}')

          def __setattr__(self, name, value):
              self._attrs[name] = value

          def __delattr__(self, name):
              del self._attrs[name]

      obj = DynamicAttributes()
