JavaScript ES2018 (ECMAScript 2018) is the ninth major release of the JavaScript language specification. It was finalized in June 2018. ES2018 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, building upon the foundation laid by ES6 (ES2015). In this tutorial, we will learn about the new features introduced in ES2018 and how to use them in your JavaScript code.

## Features of ES2018

ES2018 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the key features of ES2018 are:

1. **Asynchronous Iteration**: ES2018 introduced asynchronous iteration, which allows you to iterate over asynchronous data sources such as asynchronous generators and asynchronous iterators. You can use the `for-await-of` loop to iterate over asynchronous data sources.

   For example:

   ```javascript title="Asynchronous Iteration Example"
    async function* asyncGenerator() {
        yield 1;
        yield 2;
        yield 3;
    }

    (async () => {
        for await (let num of asyncGenerator()) {
            console.log(num);
        }
    })();
   ```

2. **Promise.prototype.finally()**: ES2018 introduced the `Promise.prototype.finally()` method, which allows you to run cleanup logic after a `Promise` is settled (either fulfilled or rejected). The `finally()` method is called when the `Promise` is settled, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Promise.prototype.finally() Example"
     let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          resolve("Success!");
     });
    
     promise.then((value) => {
          console.log(value);
     }).catch((error) => {
          console.error(error);
     }).finally(() => {
          console.log("Cleanup logic here");
     });
    ```

3. **Rest/Spread Properties**: ES2018 introduced the rest and spread properties for object literals. The rest properties allow you to extract the remaining properties of an object into a new object, while the spread properties allow you to spread the properties of an object into another object.

    For example:
    
    ```js title="Rest/Spread Properties Example"
     let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
     console.log(x); // Output: 1
     console.log(y); // Output: 2
     console.log(z); // Output: { a: 3, b: 4 }
    ```

4. **Object Rest/Spread Properties**: ES2018 also introduced rest and spread properties for object destructuring. The rest properties allow you to extract the remaining properties of an object into a new object, while the spread properties allow you to spread the properties of an object into another object.

    For example:
    
    ```js title="Object Rest/Spread Properties Example"
     let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
     console.log(x); // Output: 1
     console.log(y); // Output: 2
     console.log(z); // Output: { a: 3, b: 4 }
    ```

5. **RegExp Lookbehind Assertions**: ES2018 introduced lookbehind assertions for regular expressions. Lookbehind assertions allow you to match a pattern only if it is preceded by another pattern.

    For example:
    
    ```js title="RegExp Lookbehind Assertions Example"
     let str = "Hello, World!";
     let regex = /(?<=Hello, )World/;
     console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
    ```

6. **RegExp Unicode Property Escapes**: ES2018 introduced Unicode property escapes for regular expressions. Unicode property escapes allow you to match characters based on their Unicode properties.

    For example:
    
    ```js title="RegExp Unicode Property Escapes Example"
     let str = "😀";
     let regex = /\p{Emoji}/u;
     console.log(regex.test(str)); // Output: true
    ```

## Browser Support for ES2018

Most modern web browsers support ES2018 features, but some older browsers may not fully support all ES2018 features. To ensure that your JavaScript code works across all browsers, you can use a transpiler like Babel to convert your ES2018 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with older browsers.

ES2018 features are generally well-supported in modern web browsers, and you can start using them in your JavaScript code without the need for a transpiler in most cases.
