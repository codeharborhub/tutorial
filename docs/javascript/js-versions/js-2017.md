JavaScript ES2017 (ECMAScript 2017) is the eighth major release of the JavaScript language specification. It was finalized in June 2017. ES2017 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, building upon the foundation laid by ES6 (ES2015). In this tutorial, we will learn about the new features introduced in ES2017 and how to use them in your JavaScript code.

## Features of ES2017

ES2017 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the key features of ES2017 are:

1. **Async/Await Functions**: ES2017 introduced the `async` and `await` keywords, which allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a `Promise` is settled.

   For example:

   ```javascript title="Async/Await Example"
    function delay(ms) {
        return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
    }

    async function asyncFunction() {
        console.log("Start");
        await delay(2000);
        console.log("End");
    }

    asyncFunction();
   ```

2. **Object.values() and Object.entries()**: ES2017 introduced the `Object.values()` and `Object.entries()` methods, which allow you to get the values and entries of an object, respectively. The `Object.values()` method returns an array of the object's values, and the `Object.entries()` method returns an array of the object's key-value pairs.
   
    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Object.values() and Object.entries() Example"
     let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
     console.log(Object.values(person)); // Output: ["Alice", 30]
     console.log(Object.entries(person)); // Output: [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 30]]
    ```

3. **String Padding**: ES2017 introduced the `String.prototype.padStart()` and `String.prototype.padEnd()` methods, which allow you to pad a string with spaces or other characters to a specified length. The `padStart()` method pads the string at the beginning, and the `padEnd()` method pads the string at the end.
   
    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="String Padding Example"
     let str = "Hello";
     console.log(str.padStart(10, ".")); // Output: ".....Hello"
     console.log(str.padEnd(10, ".")); // Output: "Hello....."
    ```

4. **Shared Memory and Atomics**: ES2017 introduced the `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` objects, which allow you to work with shared memory and atomic operations in JavaScript. The `SharedArrayBuffer` object represents a shared memory region, and the `Atomics` object provides atomic operations for shared memory.
   
    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Shared Memory and Atomics Example"
     let buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16);
     let view = new Int32Array(buffer);
     view[0] = 42;

     Atomics.add(view, 0, 13);
     console.log(view[0]); // Output: 55
    ```

## Browser Support for ES2017

Most modern web browsers support ES2017 features, but some older browsers may not fully support all ES2017 features. To ensure that your JavaScript code works across all browsers, you can use a transpiler like Babel to convert your ES2017 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with older browsers.

ES2017 features are generally well-supported in modern web browsers, and you can start using them in your JavaScript code without the need for a transpiler in most cases.

:::tip Important

<h3>Why Internet Explorer does not support ES2017 features?</h3>

Internet Explorer does not support ES2017 features because it is an outdated web browser that has been replaced by Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Edge is the modern web browser from Microsoft that supports the latest web standards and features, including ES2017. It is recommended to use Microsoft Edge or other modern web browsers to ensure compatibility with the latest JavaScript features. If you need to support Internet Explorer for legacy reasons, you can use a transpiler like Babel to convert your ES2017 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with Internet Explorer.
