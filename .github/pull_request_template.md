## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure smooth collaboration and effective contribution management, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### Issue Creation

1. **Limit on Issues:**
   - Each contributor is allowed to create a maximum of **4 issues per day**. This helps us manage and address issues efficiently.

### Contribution Levels

2. **Basic Contributions:**
   - This project is primarily focused on documentation. Most of the setup has been completed, so contributors will generally need to work on basic code tasks, such as writing tests.
   - For these tasks, issues will be assigned the **level1** label.

3. **Acknowledging Hard Work:**
   - If a contributor puts in significant effort on a task, the issue will be upgraded to **level2**. This is our way of recognizing and appreciating extra effort.

4. **Feature Additions and Component Work:**
   - Contributors working on new features or components using JSX/TSX will be assigned a level based on the complexity and quality of their work.
   - The more complex and valuable the contribution, the higher the level assigned.

### Level Definitions

- **Level1:**
  - Tasks are straightforward, such as fixing minor bugs, writing tests, or making simple documentation updates.
- **Level2:**
  - Tasks require more effort, such as addressing complex bugs, improving existing features, or making substantial documentation improvements.
- **Level3:**
  - Tasks are highly complex and involve significant new feature development, major refactoring, or extensive contributions to the project’s core components.

We look forward to your contributions and appreciate your effort in helping us improve the project!
