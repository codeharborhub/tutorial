description: In this tutorial, you will learn how to insert images in HTML. Images are used to enhance the visual appeal of web pages and provide additional information to users.

To insert an image in HTML, you use the `<img>` tag.
This tag is self-closing and does not require a closing tag. 

#### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Image Insertion Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Image Example</h2>
    <img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</body>
</html>
```

- Replace `"path/to/your/image.jpg"` with the actual path to your image file.
- `"Description of the image"` should be replaced with a brief description of the image, which is important for accessibility purposes.

If you want to add a caption or additional text alongside the image, you can use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Image Insertion with Caption Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Image Example with Caption</h2>
    <figure>
        <img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <figcaption>This is a caption for the image.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</body>
</html>
```
Remember to replace `"path/to/your/image.jpg"` with your actual image path and update the caption accordingly. This structure ensures that the image is properly described and accessible.

#### Important point

When inserting images into HTML documents, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Use the `alt` Attribute**: Always include the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag. This attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is crucial for accessibility. Screen readers use this text to describe images to visually impaired users, and it also displays if the image fails to load.

2. **Specify Image Dimensions**: It's good practice to specify the dimensions of your images using the `width` and `height` attributes in the `<img>` tag. This helps browsers render the page more smoothly, as they can reserve the necessary space for the image before it loads.

3. **Choose Appropriate Image Formats**: Use the correct image format for your content. Typically, JPEG is suitable for photographs, while PNG is better for images with transparency or line art. SVG is ideal for vector graphics. Choosing the right format can optimize loading times and visual quality.

4. **Optimize Image Size**: Ensure your images are appropriately sized and optimized for the web. Large images can slow down your webpage's loading speed. Use image editing tools to resize and compress images without sacrificing too much quality.

5. **File Paths**: Double-check that your file paths (`src` attribute) are correct. Use relative paths whenever possible to ensure portability and avoid broken links when moving your files or deploying your website.

6. **Caption and Context**: When necessary, provide additional context or captions for your images using the `<figcaption>` element within a `<figure>` element. This is especially useful for images that require explanation or when the content is not immediately clear from the image alone.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your images are not only visually appealing but also enhance the accessibility and performance of your web pages.
