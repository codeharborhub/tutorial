Semantic HTML refers to HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. Using semantic tags gives the web page a structured and meaningful layout, which helps search engines to index the page better and improves accessibility for users with assistive technologies.

## What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. It uses HTML tags that give information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on the page.

Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` not only structure the content but also define its purpose.

## Importance of Semantic HTML

1. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in accessibility. Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on the structure of the document to navigate and interpret the content correctly.

2. **SEO**: Search engines give higher importance to the content within semantic markup, as it clearly defines its context and relevance. This can lead to better search engine rankings.

3. **Maintainability**: Websites built with semantic HTML are easier to maintain and update. The clear structure makes it easier for developers to understand and modify the code.

## Common Semantic HTML Elements

- **`<header>`**: Defines a header for a document or a section.
- **`<footer>`**: Specifies a footer for a document or section.
- **`<article>`**: Defines independent, self-contained content.
- **`<section>`**: Represents a generic section of a document or application.
- **`<nav>`**: Defines navigation links.
- **`<aside>`**: Marks content that is tangentially related to the content around it.

## Conclusion

Semantic HTML is essential for creating web pages that are accessible, easily maintained, and optimized for search engine rankings. By using semantic elements, developers can create web pages that not only look good but also provide a better user experience and are more inclusive. As web standards evolve, the importance of semantic HTML will continue to grow, making it a critical aspect of modern web development.
