JavaScript ES2016 (ECMAScript 2016) is the seventh major release of the JavaScript language specification. It was finalized in June 2016. ES2016 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, building upon the foundation laid by ES6 (ES2015). In this tutorial, we will learn about the new features introduced in ES2016 and how to use them in your JavaScript code.

## Features of ES2016

ES2016 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the key features of ES2016 are:

1. **Exponentiation Operator (`**`)**: ES2016 introduced the exponentiation operator (`**`), which allows you to raise one number to the power of another number. For example, `2 ** 3` is equivalent to `2 * 2 * 2`.
   
   For example:

   ```javascript title="Exponentiation Operator Example"
    let result = 2 ** 3; // 2 raised to the power of 3
    console.log(result); // Output: 8
    ```

2. **Array.prototype.includes()**: ES2016 introduced the `Array.prototype.includes()` method, which allows you to check if an array includes a specific element. It returns `true` if the array contains the element, and `false` otherwise.
   
    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Array.prototype.includes() Example"
     let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(numbers.includes(3)); // Output: true
     console.log(numbers.includes(6)); // Output: false
     ```

3. **Additional Features**: ES2016 also introduced other minor features and enhancements to JavaScript, such as the `TypedArray.prototype.includes()` method for typed arrays and the `Object.values()` and `Object.entries()` methods for objects.
   
   For example:

   ```javascript title="Object.values() and Object.entries() Example"
    let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
    console.log(Object.values(person)); // Output: ["Alice", 30]
    console.log(Object.entries(person)); // Output: [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 30]]
    ```

## Browser Support for ES2016

Most modern web browsers support ES2016 features, but some older browsers may not fully support all ES2016 features. To ensure that your JavaScript code works across all browsers, you can use a transpiler like Babel to convert your ES2016 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with older browsers.

ES2016 features are generally well-supported in modern web browsers, and you can start using them in your JavaScript code without the need for a transpiler in most cases.
