## Data Types

Java is a strongly-typed language, meaning every variable must be declared with a data type.

### Primitive Data Types

- **int**: Integer type.
- **double**: Double-precision floating point.
- **char**: Character type.
- **boolean**: Boolean type (true or false).

Example:

```java
int number = 10;
double price = 9.99;
char letter = 'A';
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```

### Reference Data Types

Reference types refer to objects and include arrays, classes, interfaces, etc.

Example:

```java
String message = "Hello, World!";
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

## Variables

Variables store data values. They must be declared before use.

### Variable Declaration

```java
int age;
String name;
```

### Variable Initialization

```java
age = 25;
name = "Alice";
```

### Combined Declaration and Initialization

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
```
