JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. And it is the most popular programming language in the world. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. The overwhelming majority of websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and smartphones—include JavaScript interpreters, making it an essential part of the web platform.

## How to use JavaScript?

JavaScript can be used in a lot of different ways. Here are a few examples:

### 1. JavaScript Can Change HTML Content

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>

    <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        "Welcome CodeHarborHub Learners!";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
    <p id="demo">Welcome CodeHarborHub Learners!</p>
</BrowserWindow>

### 2. JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>

    <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
    <p id="demo" style={{fontSize: "35px"}}>This is a paragraph.</p>
</BrowserWindow>

### 3. JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>

    <button
      type="button"
      onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='none'"
    >
      Click Me!
    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
  <p id="hidedemo">This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button onClick={()=> document.getElementById('hidedemo').style.display='none'}> Click Me! </button>
</BrowserWindow>

### 4. JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <p id="show" style="display:none">This is a paragraph.</p>

    <button
      onclick="document.getElementById('show').style.display='block'"
    >
      Click Me!
    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
  <p id="showdemo" style={{display:"none"}}>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button onClick={()=> document.getElementById('showdemo').style.display='block'}>Click Me!</button>
</BrowserWindow>

### 5. JavaScript Can Change HTML Attributes

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>

    <button
      onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.color='red'"
    >
      Click Me!
    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
  <p id="mydemo">This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button onClick={()=> document.getElementById('mydemo').style.color='red'}>Click Me!</button>
</BrowserWindow>

### 6. JavaScript Can Change HTML Image

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <img
      id="myImage"
      src="/code-harbor-hub/img/static_website.svg"
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
    />

    <button
      type="button"
      onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='/code-harbor-hub/img/static_assets.svg'"
    >
      Change Image
    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow minHeight="300px" url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
<h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
    <img
      id="myImage"
      src='/code-harbor-hub/img/svg/static_website.svg'
      width="100%"
      height="auto"
    />
    <button onClick={()=> document.getElementById('myImage').src='/code-harbor-hub/img/svg/static_assets.svg'}>Change Image</button>
</BrowserWindow>

### 7. JavaScript Can Validate Data

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

    <form
      name="myForm"
      action="#"
      onsubmit="return validateForm()"

    >
      Email: <input type="text" name="email" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

    <script>
      function validateForm() {
        let x = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
        if (x == "") {
          alert("Name must be filled out");
          return false;
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
