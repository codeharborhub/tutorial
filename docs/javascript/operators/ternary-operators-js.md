In JavaScript, the ternary operator (`? :`) is a conditional operator that takes three operands and returns a value based on a condition. It is a shorthand for the `if...else` statement.

    class TernaryOperator {
        perform(): (condition ? trueValue : falseValue)
    }

## Syntax of Ternary Operator

The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

```js {3} title="Ternary Operator Syntax" showLineNumbers
let result = (condition) ? trueValue : falseValue;
```

- `condition`: A boolean expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- `trueValue`: The value to be returned if the `condition` is `true`.
- `falseValue`: The value to be returned if the `condition` is `false`.
- `result`: The value returned based on the `condition`.
- The `trueValue` and `falseValue` can be of any data type.
- The parentheses around the entire ternary operation are optional.
- The ternary operator can be used as an expression or as part of an assignment statement.

## Example of Ternary Operator

The following example demonstrates the usage of the ternary operator:

```js {2} title="Ternary Operator Example" showLineNumbers
let age = 20;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote" : "You are not eligible to vote";
console.log(message); // Output: You are eligible to vote
```

In this example, the ternary operator checks if the `age` is greater than or equal to `18`. If the condition is `true`, it returns the message `"You are eligible to vote"`, otherwise it returns the message `"You are not eligible to vote".`

:::info üìù Note
- The ternary operator is a concise way to write simple conditional expressions, but it is recommended to use the `if...else` statement for complex conditions to improve readability.
- The ternary operator can also be used as part of an assignment statement to assign the result to a variable.
- It is also known as the conditional operator.
- It is introduced in ECMAScript 1 (1997).
