In JavaScript, classes are a new feature introduced in <mark>ES6 (ES2015)</mark> that allows you to create objects using the `class` keyword. Classes are a template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

In this tutorial, you will learn about classes in JavaScript with the help of examples.

## Classes in JavaScript

The syntax for defining a class in JavaScript is as follows:

```javascript title="Class Syntax"
class ClassName {
    constructor(param1, param2, ..., paramN) {
        // constructor body
    }

    method1(param1, param2, ..., paramN) {
        // method1 body
    }

    method2(param1, param2, ..., paramN) {
        // method2 body
    }

    // more methods...
}
```

- `ClassName`: It is the name of the class.
- `constructor`: It is a special method for creating and initializing objects created with a class. It is called when a new instance of the class is created.
- `method1, method2, ..., methodN`: These are the methods of the class.
- `param1, param2, ..., paramN`: These are the parameters of the constructor and methods.
- `this`: It is a reference to the current instance of the class.
- `new`: It is used to create a new instance of the class.
- `extends`: It is used to create a subclass that inherits from another class.
- `super`: It is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
- `static`: It is used to define static methods on a class.
- `get`: It is used to define a getter method for a property.
- `set`: It is used to define a setter method for a property.
- `prototype`: It is used to add properties and methods to the class prototype.

## Classes Examples

Let's see some examples to understand how classes work in JavaScript.

### Example 1: Creating a Class

The following example demonstrates how to create a class in JavaScript:

```javascript title="Creating a Class"
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
}

const john = new Person('John', 30);

console.log(john.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

In this example, we have defined a class `Person` with a constructor that initializes the `name` and `age` properties of the class. The `greet` method returns a greeting message with the name and age of the person.

We have created an instance of the `Person` class named `john` and called the `greet` method on it.

### Example 2: Inheritance in Classes

The following example demonstrates how to create a subclass that inherits from another class in JavaScript:

```javascript title="Inheritance in Classes"
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        return `${this.name} makes a sound.`;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        super(name);
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    speak() {
        return `${this.name} barks loudly.`;
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Labrador');

console.log(dog.speak()); // Output: Buddy barks loudly.
```

In this example, we have defined a class `Animal` with a constructor that initializes the `name` property and a `speak` method. We have also defined a subclass `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class using the `extends` keyword.

The `Dog` class has its own constructor that initializes the `name` and `breed` properties and overrides the `speak` method to return a different message.

We have created an instance of the `Dog` class named `dog` and called the `speak` method on it.

### Example 3: Static Methods in Classes

The following example demonstrates how to define static methods on a class in JavaScript:

```javascript title="Static Methods in Classes"
class MathUtils {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static subtract(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(MathUtils.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

In this example, we have defined a class `MathUtils` with two static methods `add` and `subtract` that perform addition and subtraction operations, respectively.

We have called the static methods directly on the class without creating an instance of the class.

:::info üìù Note
**Importent Points:**

- The `constructor` method is a special method that is called when a new instance of the class is created.
- The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.
- The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits from another class.
- Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.
- The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
- Getters and setters are used to define getter and setter methods for properties.
- The `prototype` property is used to add properties and methods to the class prototype.
- Arrow functions are not suitable for defining class methods as they do not have their own `this` value.
- Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model.
- Classes in JavaScript are first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.
- Classes in JavaScript are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are used.
- Classes in JavaScript can be defined in strict mode or non-strict mode.
- Classes in JavaScript can be defined in the global scope or inside a function.
- Classes in JavaScript can be defined using the `class` keyword or the `function` keyword.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about classes in JavaScript, a new feature introduced in ES6 (ES2015) that allows you to create objects using the `class` keyword. You also learned about constructors, methods, inheritance, static methods, and other features of classes in JavaScript.
