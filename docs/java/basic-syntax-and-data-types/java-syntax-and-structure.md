# Java Syntax and Structure

## Introduction

Understanding the basic syntax and structure of Java is essential for writing effective Java programs. This guide covers the fundamental elements of Java syntax and how to structure a Java program.

## Basic Syntax

### Hello World Example

The simplest Java program is a "Hello, World!" application. Here's what it looks like:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Class Declaration**: Every Java program must have at least one class definition. The class name should match the filename. In this case, `HelloWorld` is the class name.
- **Main Method**: The `main` method is the entry point of any Java application. It is always written as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
- **Statements**: Each statement ends with a semicolon (`;`). The `System.out.println` method prints the specified message to the console.

## Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler.

- **Single-line comments** start with `//`.

```java
// This is a single-line comment
```

- **Multi-line comments** are enclosed in `/* ... */`.

```java
/*
 This is a multi-line comment
 that spans multiple lines.
 */
```
