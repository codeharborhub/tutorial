Functions and closures are fundamental concepts in Swift, providing mechanisms for defining and executing reusable blocks of code.

**Functions**:
- Functions in Swift are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- They can take parameters, return values, and are reusable throughout the codebase.

**Closures**:
- Closures are anonymous functions that capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.
- They can be passed around as variables and parameters to other functions, and provide a concise syntax for inline function-like behavior.

### Concepts:

1. **Functions**:
   - **Declaration**: Defined using the `func` keyword, followed by a function name and parameters in parentheses.
   - **Parameters**: Input values passed to the function when called, specified with a name and type.
   - **Return Values**: Output values returned by the function, specified after an arrow (`->`) followed by the return type.

2. **Closures**:
   - **Closure Expression**: A block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
   - **Capture Lists**: Capture and store references to any constants and variables from the surrounding context.
   - **Syntax**: Can be written in a concise form without a name or `func` keyword.

### Example:

```swift
// Function example
func greet(person: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(person)!"
}

let greeting = greet(person: "John")
print(greeting) // Output: Hello, John!

// Closure example
let greetClosure = { (person: String) -> String in
    return "Hello, \(person)!"
}

let greetingClosure = greetClosure("Jane")
print(greetingClosure) // Output: Hello, Jane!
```

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:

- **Functions**: `greet(person:)` function takes a `String` parameter `person` and returns a `String` greeting.
- **Closures**: `greetClosure` is an anonymous closure that captures the `person` parameter and returns a greeting string.
 

- **Function Types**: Functions in Swift are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as parameters to other functions, and returned from functions.
  
- **Capturing Values**: Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the surrounding context in which they are defined.

- **Trailing Closures**: When a closure is the last argument to a function, it can be written outside the parentheses, enhancing readability.

```swift
// Example of using a trailing closure
func performAction(completion: () -> Void) {
    print("Performing action...")
    completion()
}

performAction {
    print("Action completed!")
}
// Output:
// Performing action...
// Action completed!
```

Functions and closures provide powerful tools for modularizing code, promoting reusability, and supporting functional programming paradigms in Swift. They are essential for writing clear, concise, and maintainable code in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.
