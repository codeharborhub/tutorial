JavaScript ES2020 (ECMAScript 2020) is the eleventh major release of the JavaScript language specification. It was finalized in June 2020. ES2020 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, building upon the foundation laid by ES6 (ES2015). In this tutorial, we will learn about the new features introduced in ES2020 and how to use them in your JavaScript code.

## Features of ES2020

ES2020 introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the key features of ES2020 are:

1. **BigInt**: ES2020 introduced the `BigInt` primitive type, which allows you to represent arbitrarily large integers in JavaScript. The `BigInt` type is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer literal or by calling the `BigInt()` constructor with a numeric value.

   For example:

   ```javascript title="BigInt Example"
    const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    console.log(bigNumber); // Output: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
   ```

2. **Dynamic Import**: ES2020 introduced dynamic `import()` expressions, which allow you to dynamically import modules in JavaScript. The `import()` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to the module namespace object of the requested module.

    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Dynamic Import Example"
     const modulePath = './module.js';
     import(modulePath)
        .then((module) => {
          console.log(module.default);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error(error);
        });
    ```

3. **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**: ES2020 introduced the nullish coalescing operator (`??`), which allows you to provide a default value for variables that are `null` or `undefined`. The nullish coalescing operator returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is `null` or `undefined`, and otherwise returns the left-hand operand.

    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Nullish Coalescing Operator Example"
     const name = null;
     const defaultName = name ?? 'John Doe';
     console.log(defaultName); // Output: 'John Doe'
    ```

4. **Optional Chaining Operator (`?.`)**: ES2020 introduced the optional chaining operator (`?.`), which allows you to safely access nested properties of an object without having to check if each property exists. If a property is `null` or `undefined`, the optional chaining operator short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Optional Chaining Operator Example"
     const user = {
       name: 'Alice',
       address: {
         city: 'New York',
       },
     };
     
     console.log(user.address?.city); // Output: 'New York'
     console.log(user.address?.country); // Output: undefined
    ```

5. **Promise.allSettled()**: ES2020 introduced the `Promise.allSettled()` method, which returns a `Promise` that resolves after all the input `Promises` have settled (either fulfilled or rejected). The `Promise` returned by `Promise.allSettled()` resolves with an array of objects that describe the outcome of each `Promise`.

    For example:
    
    ```javascript title="Promise.allSettled() Example"
     const promises = [
       Promise.resolve(1),
       Promise.reject(new Error('Error!')),
       Promise.resolve(3),
     ];
     
     Promise.allSettled(promises)
       .then((results) => {
         results.forEach((result) => {
           console.log(result.status, result.value);
         });
       });
    ```

## Browser Support for ES2020

Most modern web browsers support ES2020 features, but some older browsers may not fully support all ES2020 features. To ensure that your JavaScript code works across all browsers, you can use a transpiler like Babel to convert your ES2020 code into ES5 code, which is compatible with older browsers.

ES2020 features are generally well-supported in modern web browsers, and you can start using them in your JavaScript code without the need for a transpiler in most cases.
